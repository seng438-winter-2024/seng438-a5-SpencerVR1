# Introduction

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

## Result of model comparison (selecting top two models)

We overlayed all the models over each other and deselected the worst ones until we were left with the best two. We found that the best models were 'TL' and 'IFRGSB'. The model comparison tab confirmed this, as those two models exhibited the lowest log-likelihood scores which is a metric that indicates its goodness of fit.

## Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis)	

## Plots for failure rate and reliability of the SUT for the test data provided
